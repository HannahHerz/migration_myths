      <p>In conclusion? For high-income regions like the EU, it's unrealistic to think that more development abroad will mean fewer migrants...</p>

    <p>
      Many believe that people migrate irregularly to access free services such as healthcare or education in wealthier countries. The idea is that migrants are drawn by the prospect of receiving public benefits without having contributed to the system. As a result, some governments have attempted to restrict access to these services as a way to reduce irregular migration. But the evidence tells a different story.

      <p>While access to basic services like healthcare and education can improve a person’s quality of life, they are not the main reason people migrate—especially not irregularly. Studies consistently show that the top factors influencing migration are better job opportunities, higher wages, safety, and political freedom—not access to welfare.</p>
